*This short video describes some of the sensory processing sensitivies that some autistic people experience.*

Autistic people have sensory processing sensitivities and differences when compared to neurotypical people.
These differences can make it difficult to navigate environments that were not built with autistic people in mind.
For example, it can be stressful to taking a busy train during rush hour, or to attend an appointment in a brightly lit hospital waiting room.

Every person is different.
We want to gather many autistic people‚Äôs stories together.
Our goal is to:
1. Share the stories with people who have similar experiences
2. Educate neurotypical people on how they can better support autistic people
3. Advise people on how they can design and adapt spaces to improve autistic people‚Äôs lives.

*This short video introduces the goals of the Citizen Science project.*

**The purpose of this study is to co-design and co-produce a framework for ethical, participatory, citizen science.**
We cannot build this tool without the input of a diverse community of autistic people and their relatives and carers.
We also welcome open source developers to help us build this platform.
The first phase of this project is to **co-design the online platform by identifying priorities and requirements from our community members**.
