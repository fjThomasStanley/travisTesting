# Autistica/Turing citizen science project: Planned outputs

**Kirstie Whitaker & Georgia Aitkenhead**

_This document outlines the projected outputs of the project._

### Platform

An online platform where citizen scientists can upload their experiences of navigating the environment.
It will be open source and openly developed from the start of the project.
The platform will be scalable to accommodate at least 1000 active users (hopefully more).
It will be collaboratively developed to include a user-friendly interface interacting with a structured and secure database.
Our timeline projects a minimum viable product available in autumn 2019, with the main platform launched in March 2020.
The platform will be iteratively improved based on user feedback.

### Dataset

A curated dataset that has informed consent from participants of the citizen science project that can be shared with researchers for future work.
The data will be kept secure and only made available under managed access.
The consent model that will be developed in 2019 will ensure that contributors to the project are able to control which research partners are able to access their data and for what purpose.

### Community

Two – hopefully overlapping – communities will be built and supported over the course of the project.
One will focus on communicating shared experiences between autistic citizen scientists and readers of the experiences on the platform.
The other will consist of contributors to the open source platform, building a community of designers, software developers and data scientists in conversation with autistic collaborators.

### Publications

- **Position paper:** a peer-reviewed academic article laying out the values, incentives, structures, and requirements of a platform to conduct citizen science on autistic people's experiences navigating their environment.
  This will also include a fine-grained consent model based on input from the autistic community.
  Our timeline projects submission of this paper by 1 August 2019.
- **Presentation paper** : a peer-reviewed academic article presenting the final platform and reporting on lessons learned in building a citizen science project to share autistic people's experiences navigating their environment.
  This will cover the successes and challenges of a fine-grained consent model, a report on the communities built over the course of the project and the open source software developed to support the platform.
  Our timeline projects submission of this paper in summer 2020.
- **Research paper** : a peer-reviewed academic article presenting the outcome of results of an analysis to understand and communicate how autistic people navigate their environment.
  This will be conducted in collaboration with other research groups.
  Our timeline projects that this project will start in autumn 2020 and be submitted for publication in winter 2021.
