# Newsletter | September 2019

*Date sent: 20 September 2019*

Subject: September updates from the Autistica/Turing Citizen Science project

Hello,

This is the September 2019 newsletter for the Autistica/Turing Citizen Science project.

### Thank you for your feedback

We've had some excellent, really useful feedback after our first newsletter.
Thank you everyone!

Some of you told us that there was too much information in the last newsletter, and that the text was not broken up enough, so we've changed how this one is written.
We hope it's a little easier to follow!

### Project website

Some of the feedback said that the GitHub repository was confusing.
There were too many additional pieces of information on the page that made it difficult to focus on what we were saying!

So we've **made a website for the project**: [https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/AutisticaCitizenScience](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/AutisticaCitizenScience).
It has a lot of the same information as the GitHub repository, but is hopefully easier to read.

Please check it out and let us know what you think.

### Telling us what you think

We really appreciate your comments about what the priorities for the project should be and what the barriers to participation are at the moment.

The best way to share your feedback and suggestions with us is to **fill in our online survey**: [https://bit.ly/AutisticaTuringCitSciForm](https://bit.ly/AutisticaTuringCitSciForm).

The main question on the form is quite vague because it is designed to capture a broad range of comments.
We know that can be frustrating and we're working on making the contribution process easier based on your feedback.

The reason we like capturing your suggestions there is that they become openly available for all the team members building the citizen science platform.
If you find the form confusing or don't want to have your suggestion (without your name) publicly available, you can also **email Georgia** at [gaitkenhead@turing.ac.uk](mailto:gaitkenhead@turing.ac.uk).

### Upcoming activities

We are running three focus groups in the next few weeks with members of Autistica's [Insight Group](https://www.autistica.org.uk/get-involved/calmer-christmas/help-shape-research).
These are in partnership with Fujitsu who [voted to make Autistica their Charity Partner](https://www.fujitsu.com/uk/about/local/corporate-responsibility/charity-partner/) earlier this year.

At the focus groups we will demonstrate a very, very early stage [demonstration of the citizen science platform](https://autistica-demo-deployment.herokuapp.com).
We will work with the teams at [Open Humans](https://autistica-demo-deployment.herokuapp.com/) and Fujitsu to improve this over the next few weeks.
Stay tuned for a more accessible example in October's newsletter.

### Thank you!

We really appreciate you joining us in helping to build a more inclusive world for autistic people who have sensory processing sensitivities and differences.

All the best,

Kirstie and Georgia
