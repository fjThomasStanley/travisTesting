Hello,

Welcome, and thank you for your interest in the Autistica/Turing Citizen Science Project.
We have some exciting news!
We now have ethics approval for the project, which means that we can start co-designing the platform with your input and feedback.
Thank you so much to everyone who has contributed so far!
We are in the process of developing ways of collaborating, and we are still at the very beginnings of the design stage, so any input on how we can make it easier for you to be involved, or about the project more generally, would be really helpful.

### Project Overview

The goal is to investigate how sensory processing differences affect the ways autistic people navigate the world around them.
Autistic people, as well as their relatives and carers, will be involved as collaborators from the start, and the project will be in the service of longer, healthier, happier lives for autistic people.

How sensory processing affects navigating different environments is an area which is still not well understood, but which we know can have a huge impact on people’s lives.
It was chosen as a priority for autism research in collaboration with members of the autistic community.
Investigating this area will increase people’s understanding of autism and daily life, connect people with others who share similar experiences, and help provide evidence to conduct more research and modify environments so that they are better suited to autistic people.

In order to investigate the topic, we will co-design a citizen science platform in collaboration with autistic people, their relatives, carers, and allies, where people who are not professional scientists can enter their experiences about navigating the world around them.
This will include making sure people have control over how their data is used, who it is shared with, and for what purposes.

The first stage is to co-design the platform.

We are now ready to begin co-designing the platform!
This is the phase before the platform is publicly launched.
Only then can it be used to collect data on sensory processing and environments.
We expect the platform to be publicly launched in Spring 2020.

You can get involved now to decide what kind of a platform gets made, and how it gets made.

### How to get Involved

There are many ways to get involved with the Autistica/Turing Citizen Science project team.
Please start by reading the participant information sheet which contains important information on who can be involved, and what to expect from involvement.

* You can anonymously, publicly share your suggestions via the "always open" google form: https://bit.ly/AutisticaTuringCitSciForm.
This form is deliberately quite open, so that there is lots of freedom for you to tell us about your thoughts about the project and the platform.
We will use the response to the survey to better design the platform as well as to better manage and run the project itself.
* Visit us at our GitHub repository.
GitHub is a site where we will be able to build the platform publicly online, and where volunteers can contribute.
A ‘repository’ is the online space where all the documents and files relating to the project are stored and managed on GitHub.
You are welcome to use this site to raise issues about the project or comment on the project documentation, which we have uploaded there.
If you are a coder or developer, you will also be able to contribute code via. GitHub.
* Join the discussion in our issues and pull requests on GitHub

* Come and say hello in our gitter channel.
This is a public messaging channel where you can interact with the research team and other commenters.
* You can contact research associate Georgia Aitkenhead by email at gaitkenhead@turing.ac.uk.

Thank you to everyone who has already helped with the project so far! To all new subscribers, we're excited to have you on board.

Very best wishes,

Kirstie and Georgia
